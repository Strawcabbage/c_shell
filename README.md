Description:

  This is my own shell that I made in c. Its current functionality includes: basic commands such as ls, mkdir, and rm; built-in commands help, cd, exit, and history; piping; and I/O redirection. I have split up the program into multiple files based on how functions are   used with a header file called "shell.h". This program is compiled using the gcc compiler and a make file.


Steps to run:

  1. Clone repository
  2. Run the command 'make' in the root
  3. use the command './myshell' to start the program
  4. After making changes run 'make clean' to clean up previous compiled code
  5. Then run 'make' again before starting the program
